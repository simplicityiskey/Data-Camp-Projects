This is all the projects that I completed on the Data Camp course


Futuristic electric car charging
The US Government's Alternative Fuels Data Center collects records of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, including charging ports and station locations, as well as sales of electric vehicles. With the EV market rapidly evolving, it's essential to understand the growth trends in charging facilities and sales to inform strategic planning.
As a data scientist working for a leading EV charging network operator, you recognize the potential in this data and start wrangling and visualizing the aggregated yearly data.

This yearly data captured in December of each year encompasses a record of EV charging port installations and station localities spanning roughly ten years, capturing both public and private charging environments. 
The data is stored in two CSV files.

Variable	Description
year	Year of data collection
private_ports	The number of available charging ports owned by private companies in a given year
private_station_locations	The number of privately owned station locations for EV charging
public_ev_charging.csv

Variable	Description
year	Year of data collection
public_ports	The number of available charging ports under public ownership in a given year
public_station_locations	The number of publicly owned station locations for EV charging
The sales information is available for each model and year in the ev_sales.csv file:

Variable	Description
Vehicle	Electric vehicle model
year	Year of data collection
sales	The number of vehicles sold in the US
